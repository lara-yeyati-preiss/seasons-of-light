# Seasons of Light

A small dataviz capturing a year of daylight in UtqiaÄ¡vik, Alaska (2024).  
Each tile marks a day, colored by its share of daylight hours: from polar night (0h) to midnight sun (24h).

## How it works
- One tile = one day.  
- Color encodes hours of daylight: flat colors for 0h (polar night) and 24h (midnight sun); a smooth gradient for values in between.  
- A tooltip shows the date, category, and daylight.
